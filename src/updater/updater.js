/*
  an updater holds state about which nodes are mounted and in which order. a node
  is an instance of the useSelector hook. for `connect` wrapped components there
  is only one node per component instance. For users of useSelector there may be
  many nodes per component instance

  The updater is responsible for calling update functions for each node and
  scheduling re-renders when a state selection is changed. It guarantees components
  will re-render from top down and that for any given state update a component will
  render at most once

  @TODO a note about testing: this updater technique relies of a frequent handing
  off between a work loop and react. act returns before all update work can complete
  in many cases leaind to failed test assertions. To allow for updates to flush fully
  the react-dom library was updated to 16.9.0-alpha.0 to allow the user of

  await act(async () => {...})

  this helps but is not perfect in cases where multiple store dispatches are executed
  synchronously. with enough deferral things will work out but it is not immediatley
  obvious how to guarantee updates fully flush before returning control to the test

    doUpdateWork loops over the queue in parts, delegating to react when the
    first node requiring a re-render is found for that execution

    the queue append only structure paired with render time node creation
    guarantees that no "dependent" node (a child component or sibling
    useSelect ocurring after this one) can ocurr in the queue to the left of
    that node

    for example given a node queue of A -> B -> C -> D

    we guarantee that B cannot depend on C or D. said another way, nodes to the
    left of a node CAN affect it's select function or parentProps (if using connect)
    and nodes to the right of a node CANNOT.

    With this in mind, one way to guarantee top down updates is to simply update
    each node in sequence. this doUpdateWork is executed as a loop, delegating
    to react each time it schedules a single react state update and continueing
    when that update has been rendered and committed.

    this structure has some performance penalties because the commit phase is
    relatively expensive for the first react fiber update effect and each additional
    one adds very little extra cost in most cases because the fiber tree is
    traversed. there are performance gains elsewhere in this design that cause
    this performance hit to be balanced out somewhat. more investigative work on
    this should be done
